    "  * Inspect the output signal via this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also note that there are a few parameters for the AGC circuit, which we can set from software as well. Just before we start interacting with our AGC circuit, let's take a moment to look at it's design and appreciate what its behaviour should be. Our circuit is loosely based on the algorithm presented in [this book](https://www.elsevier.com/books/rf-and-digital-signal-processing-for-software-defined-radio/rouphael/978-0-7506-8210-7)[1] (and there's a free excerpt from the AGC section [online](https://www.edn.com/wireless-101-automatic-gain-control-agc/)[2]).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use AGC?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the AGC circuit is to keep a signal's average power steady, at a known level. This is used to mitigate fluctuations in a signal's received power. In the analogue world, this is often to ensure that we present a full-scale signal to our ADC to minimise the impact of quantisation errors. We'll show the use of such an external analogue gain with RFSoC in a future notebook. However, there are quite a few uses in the digital world too --- generally when we want to normalise signals digitally at IF or baseband. Synchronisation for QAM receivers is one example. The synchronisation task is much simpler if we have a priori knowledge of the signal's average power, since we know what amplitude to expect for each point in the constellation. We can use an AGC, just like this one, to ensure our synchronisation circuit is given a signal with it's preferred average power. This can not only \"correct\" the received signal's power, but also adjust for any changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Our AGC circuit is a feedback loop that will amplify our signal, aiming to match a reference average power. There are 3 main parameters we will be tuning from software: the desired average power (ref), the number of samples used to calculate the average power (window), and how aggressively we want to vary our gain (alpha).\n",

    "\n",
    "Our control is based on the _logarithm_ of the input power... and these $log_{10}(x)$ and $10^{x}$ blocks _really_ complicate the digital design. A much simpler AGC design could respond linearly (instead of logarithmically) but this would have slightly different behaviour. We opt for the more painful route for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The log response lets us react to large abrupt changes to the input signal roughly as quickly as we can to small changes. This is a nice property to have when dealing with packets or bursts of data. It also simplifies any analysis if we can assume that the \"recovery time\" is independent of the input signal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * It will make it easier to interface to analogue Variable Gain Amplifiers (VGAs) in the future. Most  VGAs offer a control for their gain that is \"linear in dB\" (i.e. it's logarithmic!). By having our control loop already using logarithms, we could have direct linear control of a VGA without extra interfacing circuitry.\n",

    "> ### Slow Fading\n",
    "> Here we have an effect that emulates \"slow fading\" of a simple signal. We'd usually expect this to be caused by movement, often with buildings or terrain impeding the signal. If the receiver is sensitive to the amplitude of the received signal (e.g. AM or many QAM synchronisers), we'd need use an AGC to compensate for the changes in signal strength.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Try different window and alpha parameters to see how constant you can keep the output power. Notice that increasing the window size will reduce the time resolution of our gain control, which leads to a noticeable saw-tooth envelope for slow fading effects. If alpha is too high, we can see the output ringing where we've overshot by adjusting the gain too aggressively. If alpha is too low, we might not be compensating quickly enough for the fading effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### AM Envelope Preservation\n",
    "> AM demodulation is a classic AGC example. For AM radio receivers, we want to play baseband signals with a fixed average power so broadcasts from different locations are all audible (and the more powerful ones aren't deafening!). Our information is encoded in the envelope of the signal and we need to be very careful not to distort it. If our AGC reacts too quickly, it can start to smooth out the envelope, destroying our information. Try reducing the window until this starts to happen. The window length is shown as the grey rectangle on the output plot. Try to achieve the same effect by decreasing the modulated \"Data\" frequency as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Packet Preambles with QPSK\n",
    "> Here we present a bursty QPSK transmission, as if receiving a single packet.\n",
    "> We can clearly see the recovery time the AGC needs in order to converge to a steady gain. Having this steady, known power can be important for synchronisation (especially for higher order QAMs) and we can change this level using the ref parameter. However the AGC's recovery time means that the first few symbols will likely not be received correctly. In this situation we need to tune our AGC parameters to ensure we'll reach equilibrium before the packet's preamble is finished (or vice versa). We can tune our alpha, ref, and window parameters and then deduce the minimum preamble length that would be appropriate for this packet format. Just like our AM scenario, QPSK and QAM signals will start to become distorted if our window is small relative to the symbol period.\n",

For RFSoC devices our I/Q values will be 16 bit and we immediately multiply it by our gain. Even a small gain would take our signal beyond the 18 bit limit, so each $x^2$ operation would consume 4 DSP48 slices! Beyond this, we still face the challenge of implementing the $\\sqrt{x}$ function. This is much harder to implement directly with our standard set of arithmetic features. We could do this using a technique such as CORDIC (presented in the [next section](#4.2.-Logarithms-and-exponentials)) but since the multiplications are also a little awkward to implement, let's consider an approximation for the whole function.\n",

    "This somewhat surprising approximation reduces the power estimation to one comparison (to find the min and max of our inputs), one addition, and two multiplications. This is a very good starting point, but we can avoid even the multiplications if we intelligently select values for our constants, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Some suggested values are listed by a lovely little bit of software by [Grant R. Griffin](https://dspguru.com/dsp/tricks/magnitude-estimator/)[3].

We can model these constant multiplications as a graph of shifts and additions/subtractions. We could probably construct this graph intuitively for simple examples but we can rely on software tools such as the [SPIRAL project](http://spiral.ece.cmu.edu/mcm/gen.html) to construct graphs for more awkward coefficients[4].

A single-cycle approach was appealing in the context of this AGC because we'd like to avoid introducing extra latency into our feedback loop. The longer our latency, the greater the potential for our control signal to \"ring\" or oscillate around our desired value. Unfortunately this approach requires FPGA resources that grow exponentially with the desired precision. This worked very nicely for wordlengths around 16 bits, but our full 26 bit words would pose a serious challenge. While our final design uses the second approach, both are interesting to discuss.\n",

Volder noted that we can rotate a vector by simply incrementing the $x$ coordinate by a power-of-two fraction (a right shift) of the $y$ coordinate and vice versa. This means we only need two additions and a shift for each rotation. The main disadvantage of this simple rotation is that the magnitude of the vector is slightly distorted, but we can correct for this with a constant multiplication or wisely selecting our input values.\n",

This step was contributed by [J. S. Walther](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1478786.1478840) when unifying some of Volder's ideas. This is important to us because we can express both $\\ln(x)$ and $e^x$ in terms of hyperbolic trigonometric functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln(x) = 2 \\tanh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x+1}\\right) \\\\\n",
    "e^x = \\sinh(x) + \\cosh(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to include the same base-changing expression as in the previous section and we can move from base $e$ to base $10$ with a single constant multiplication. There we have it --- a circuit for logarithms and exponentials for large wordlengths! Again, all of the source code for this is available on [our GitHub](https://github.com/strath-sdr/pynq_agc). We'd also like to thank Adam Walker who has published [a suite of DSP implementations](https://github.com/adamwalker/clash-utils) in Clash, including a non-hyperbolic CORDIC that was a useful reference for this work[8].\n",

    "We've presented a digital AGC design for use at baseband or IF, and provided an interactive GUI to help _gain_ an intuitive understanding of how the AGC behaves. We've discussed some example scenarios which highlight real-world applications for such an AGC design and how this influences our choice of reference power, alpha, and window length parameters. We've also dived into two interesting parts of the hardware design in detail, explaining how some of the more advanced mathematical functions can be implemented cheaply on the FPGA fabric. Hopefully this has encouraged a better understanding of how AGCs work, what they can be used for, and some memorable DSP tricks for your own hardware designs.\n",

    "We will shortly release another version of this demonstration that uses an external Variable Gain Amplifier and some of the RFSoC's signal monitoring features, so watch this space if you have an RFSoC.\n",
